# Project on Kaggle data: Airbnb prices in European cities
**Authors:** Elis Vingisar and Rahel Pettai

## Project Overview
This project explores Airbnb housing prices in 10 European cities, with a focus on variations between weekdays and weekends. The primary goals are to develop a predictive model for Airbnb accommodation prices and to analyze price variations. The insights gained will assist travellers in budgeting their trips and enable hosts to set competitive rates.

For a detailed walkthrough of the analysis, please refer to our Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.
